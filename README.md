Gif tiles are small modular displays that can play animated gifs. The tiles share a common usb power source and connect magnetically so they can be rearranged as one likes and multiple tiles only use one power cable. The tiles use an esp8266 module and gifs are uploaded easily from any computer in the WiFi network via a basic GUI i called tileman.

This is going to cover the software side of this project. If you are looking for the hardware side and building instructions they can be found at [insert link] .
